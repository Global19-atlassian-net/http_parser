## 2.1.0

* Added `WebSocketChannel`, an implementation of `StreamChannel` that's backed
  by a `WebSocket`.

* Deprecated `CompatibleWebSocket` in favor of `WebSocketChannel`.

## 2.0.0

* Removed the `DataUri` class. It's redundant with the `Uri.data` getter that's
  coming in Dart 1.14, and the `DataUri.data` field in particular was an invalid
  override of that field.

## 1.1.0

* The MIME spec says that media types and their parameter names are
  case-insensitive. Accordingly, `MediaType` now uses a case-insensitive map for
  its parameters and its `type` and `subtype` fields are now always lowercase.

## 1.0.0

This is 1.0.0 because the API is stableâ€”there are no breaking changes.

* Added an `AuthenticationChallenge` class for parsing and representing the
  value of `WWW-Authenticate` and related headers.

* Added a `CaseInsensitiveMap` class for representing case-insensitive HTTP
  values.
